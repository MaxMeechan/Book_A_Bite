        The Fusion Feast: Book A Bite website was created by 5 members of Group 7E: Ryan O'Byrne, Max Meechan, Kyle Smith, Keyaan Sadiq and Bowen Sun. Our goal was to make an amazing website for every user to have an easy experience to book the restaurant for food, browse the variety of the restaurant's menu and leave reviews on how they enjoyed their restaurant experience whilst all making this user-friendly and efficiently interactive.
